              <h2>What I Do</h2>
              <p>
                I am a full stack software engineer currently living in my moms
                basement ðŸ˜­. I am working on open-source projects, freelancing
                and fleshing out my own personal ideas.
                <br />
                <br />I mainly tinker with web and native apps, mostly in
                <strong> JavaScript</strong> and <strong>React</strong>.

              <h2>How I got here</h2>
              <p>
                Before I dived into the world of programming I worked as a
                server at a very lovely dine-in theater but quickly realized
                that that was not for me... at all.
                <br />
                <br />
                I've always been fascinated with the future (I know I know, not
                much of a surprise) not only how it will look but also how we'll
                get there.

            <p>
              I love programming and learning new things - as a result I
              frequently work on side-projects and applications to further
              increase my skills.
